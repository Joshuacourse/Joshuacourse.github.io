## Most popular `pandas`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `numpy`, and `scipy` functions on Github  

To see examples of the top 10 most popular functions for each library check out [the ipython notebook file](https://github.com/agalea91/most_popular_functions/blob/master/popular_python_functions.ipynb).

You could also take a look at [my blog post about it](https://galeascience.wordpress.com/2016/08/10/top-10-pandas-numpy-and-scipy-functions-on-github/).

The figures below show the most popular functions, ordered by the number of unique repositories containing instances. For example we see that `pd.Timestamp` is not as often used in a project as a number of others, but if used once its likely to be found many times in the project code.
